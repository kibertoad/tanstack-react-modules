# @tanstack-react-modules/cli

Scaffolding CLI for the Reactive modular framework. Creates projects, modules, and stores with full wiring.

## Commands

```bash
reactive init <name> --scope @myorg --module dashboard   # New project
reactive create module <name> --route billing             # New module
reactive create store <name>                              # New Zustand store
```

All commands support interactive (prompts) and non-interactive (flags) modes. See the [main README](../../README.md#cli-reference) for full documentation.

## Development

Requires Node.js 24+.

```bash
pnpm build          # Compile TypeScript
pnpm dev            # Watch mode
```

## Testing

### Unit tests (cli-testlab)

Tests CLI commands by executing them as child processes and asserting on output and generated files.

```bash
pnpm test
```

### E2E tests (Playwright)

Smoke tests that validate the full framework end-to-end: scaffold a project via CLI, start the dev server, and interact with the served UI using Playwright.

```bash
pnpm test:e2e:setup    # Scaffold project, build framework, install deps
pnpm test:e2e:server   # Start vite dev server on port 5188 (run in background)
pnpm test:e2e          # Run Playwright tests against the running server
```

The setup script uses `link:` overrides to point `@tanstack-react-modules/core` and `@tanstack-react-modules/runtime` to the local built packages (since they aren't published to npm yet).

To re-scaffold from scratch:

```bash
pnpm clean             # Remove dist + test artifacts
pnpm build             # Rebuild CLI
pnpm test:e2e:setup    # Re-scaffold
```
